      <description>Background on the Task     Object Detection is the process of identifying things from an image or a video. It can be used tin many practical applications such as security, face detection, vehicle detection etc. We try to detect objects in the given video.
 In this day and age CCTV video monitoring has become a tedious task and is very time taking and very error-prone. This project of ours will take on that problem as we try to solve the ever existing problem of CCTV monitoring, mainly vehicle and human detection and frequency assertion.</description>
