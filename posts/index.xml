      <description>This year’s Cassava Leaf detection challenge was a very good one as many more people participated compared to the last year where only 86 teams participated in comparison there were over 3500+ teams that took part this year. I joined this challenge a bit later. I am placed at 1444/3900 teams (top 38%). I missed the medal this time around but am pretty happy on surviving the shapeup which shot me up 425 places up the Leader board.</description>

      <description>Background on the Task     Object Detection is the process of identifying things from an image or a video. It can be used tin many practical applications such as security, face detection, vehicle detection etc. We try to detect objects in the given video.
 In this day and age CCTV video monitoring has become a tedious task and is very time taking and very error-prone. This project of ours will take on that problem as we try to solve the ever existing problem of CCTV monitoring, mainly vehicle and human detection and frequency assertion.</description>

      <description>Introduction    We train the machine to recognize handwritten Alphabets. We prepared our own dataset for the project. This trained machine learning model can be then used in various other applications like word recognition, English OCR etc. All the relevant code can be found Here.This was the first Mini-Project that I did in my Bachelor&amp;rsquo;s. This project was done under the guidance of Mr. Amit Patel.
The Data for the Task    This data has been collected and segmented manually by my team.</description>
